*Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook*

- Cleaned, transformed, and analyzed a dataset of 1000 students to explore behavioral drivers of academic performance

- Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, K-Means for segmentation, LDA for classification (88.5% accuracy), and MANOVA for hypothesis testing

- Produced a professional report including visualizations, performance metrics, and data-driven recommendations

- Demonstrated advanced preprocessing techniques (outlier removal, skew correction, encoding, standardization)
